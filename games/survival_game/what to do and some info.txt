How to Play and Survival Mechanics:
Try to survive for as long as you can!

.To move use wasd (w up, a left, s down, d right)

.Every object beside the pond and the tree have health. Once its health goes to 0, it will spawn another one of that object somewhere on the map, and also its health is reset.

.To raise your 'food left', collect berries by walking to the bush, and pressing "e". After press "1" to eat them.

.To collect rocks, walk up and touch the rock, and then press "e".

.To raise your hydration walk into the pond, but watch your warmth. When in the pond your warmth will go down, and hydration will go up. The pond has no health so it is an infinite source of water.

.When the background goes gray, that means its night. It will start when time is 12, and end at 24. This will also lower you warmth.

.To raise your warmth, build a campfire by having 2 stones, and 2 wood, and then press 2. You must stand where you want it to appear. You can only have 1 campfire at a time. After you have built one, it will last 30 seconds until you will need a new one.

.To get more wood faster build a axe. for this you need 7 stone, and 7 wood, then press "3" Then you can walk up to the pine tree, and press "e". this will give you 2 wood every press. The tree has no health so it is an infinite source of wood.

.At night, a zombie will appear (the green blob entity with deformed size eyes). He will slowly crawl toward you, and if he touches you you will loose health fast. To fight the zombie be touching him and press 'e'. He has 7 health, so hit him seven times to kill it. Once you have killed it, a new one will spawn randomly on the map.

.To regain health, you will need to have the three stats warmth, hydration, and food left equal to 85 or greater. If health is equal or greater than 100 it will not go over 100. Same for the other stats.

.If warmth, hydration, or food left ever go to zero, your health will go down.

.If health is zero WASTED will appear and that means you are dead. Under the message it will say how many days you have survived.
